# Face Emotion Tracker - Python Project  

Welcome to the **Face Emotion Tracker**, a project developed in collaboration with the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). This tool uses computer vision and machine learning to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions in real-time.  

## Project Description  
The goal of this project is to identify basic human emotions (such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise) using a webcam feed. It leverages **OpenCV** for face detection and **TensorFlow/Keras** for emotion classification.  

### Key Features:  
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Analyzes facial expressions from a live video feed.  
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves an accuracy of over **90%** for basic emotions.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Displays the detected emotion on the screen in real-time.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: The core programming language.  
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and video processing.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the emotion classification model.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and analysis.  

## Why This Project?  
This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to solve real-world problems. It also reflects my interest in human-computer interaction and innovative applications of AI.
